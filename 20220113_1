3.33am, so I slept & wake up at the middle of the night to learn github :))
now at https://github.com/jztroi/merge-conflicts/pull/3/files
if I add a file & commit it, file changes will show all +
then I delete some dummy lines, like this

then commit
then edit the file to keep it, it won't show file changes
